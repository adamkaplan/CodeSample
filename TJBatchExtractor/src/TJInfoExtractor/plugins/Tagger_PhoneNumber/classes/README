# INTRODUCTION

These files constitute a feature extractor designed specifically
for extracting the below information from escort ads captured
from Backpage's female escort section.

The extractor is built on top of GATE's JAPE regular expression
language. It combines a custome integer identification plugin
with several JAPE pieces and a gazetteer (lookup table).

#---------------------------------------------------------
# FEATURES
The following is a description of the features extracted,
their definitions, and notes about notation. Many features
may be multi-valued (e.g. multiple names or phone numbers
referenced). In such cases, each value is ';' separated. The
fields are ',' separated.

It should be noted that many of these features have not been
normalized. So, for example, blond and blonde may both 
appear as hair colors, despite having the same interpretation.

Features that are broken in to pieces such as height and restrictions, are
lumped together for the purposes of this evaluation.

Prevalence - the count of feature occurrence / number of ads
Correct - the count of feature occurrences correctly extracted
Partial - the count of feature occurrences extracted, albeit incorrectly
Missing - the count of feature occurrences missed (i.e. false negatives)
False pos - the count of falsely identified occurrences
